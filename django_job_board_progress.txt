Django Job Board Project - Progress Notes

Date: 2025-09-01

What we did today:

1. Setup Django Project
   - Created a new Django project and app called 'jobs'.
   - Configured settings.py (added 'jobs' to INSTALLED_APPS).

2. Custom User Model
   - Defined a custom User model with a 'role' field (Employer or Student).
   - Replaced default Django User with AUTH_USER_MODEL.

3. Admin Setup
   - Created a superuser.
   - Logged into Django admin panel.
   - Confirmed admin site is working.

4. Job & Application Models
   - Created Job model with fields: title, description, location, salary, posted_by, posted_at.
   - Created Application model with fields: job, student, resume, status, applied_at.
   - Registered both models in admin.py so they show up in admin dashboard.

5. Database Migration
   - Ran 'python manage.py makemigrations' and 'python manage.py migrate' to update DB.

6. Admin Testing
   - Verified Jobs and Applications are visible in admin panel.
   - Confirmed Employer can post jobs and Students can apply (via admin for now).

Next Step:
- Build signup/login pages for Employers and Students (separate registration flows).
